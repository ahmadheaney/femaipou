I just completed Mission 46, after a very long and suffered first experience. It took me more than two years to complete my first run, because I was stuck after the battle with the Sahelanthropus, and I was not able to unlock the following missions. At the same time, the reviews and the negative comments about the epilogue pulled me away from the game for over a year, making me lose all the hype and interest.

So I'm going to lay my cards down that I really did not like this game. From its awful story to dodgy controls, and artificial spikes in difficulty, it was just a long and laborious slog to finish all 20 missions. If others happen to love it, I won't tell you you're wrong, but to me, AC is taking a downward spiral. I've completed the game once, and only once so far, and that was on hard difficulty. Sound Track \- The OST for the Ace Combat series is widely revered. Razgriz When I was first confronted with Ihatovo Monogatari some years ago, I thought it was just one among many interesting, and yet unlocalized, Super Famicom JRPGs, one with an aesthetic somewhat reminiscent of Laplace no Maou, at least from the few pixelated screenshots I could use to make any sort of evaluation. Some time after that, thanks to a well-written article on HardcoreGaming, I realized the "interesting" part was very much true, while the "JRPG" one was possibly a marketing Happy New Year EXO-L's! 2018 was such an amazing year for EXO on both individual and group levels, and to show you that we compiled a summary of a few of the amazing things EXO did. We are so proud of everything they have accomplished this year, not only in the music industry but in all the areas of the entertainment world that they were able to explore. 2019 is just beginning but we are off to an amazing start with fantastic news about Kai's happiness, and our lovely EXO-M members being. The media we consume affects us deeply without us realizing. That's why in 2018 I journalled about EVERY piece of media I consumed. In order to keep it relevant to this sub, I've only mentioned the manga and anime. All the significant entertainment I watched, read or heard in 2018, I penned my thoughts about it. You may find something interesting to you within this. Tell me what you guys think! ----------------------------- January Black Lagoon (7 Jan 2018) : Enjoyed the morality. 
Today we're back with Meta fanartist, u/PoisonousBoba ! Let's jump right into the interview! \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Ok, ok. Let’s try to keep it interesting. I’ll start off with the 3 “important” questions. What is your favourite color? What did you really think of Star’s brownies? And who do you have a crush Hello/Bonjour! It's me, /u/R_E_S_I_G_N_E_D. Maybe you know me from my innocuous biweekly discussion thread comments. What you (probably) don’t know about me is that I am Canadian. As such, I am contractually obligated to prefer music made by Canadians. Fortunately for me, there is no shortage of terrific indie music created by patriots of the great white north for me to hyperbolically gush over. We are going to rating four of the best and best-remembered indie rock/pop albums of the mid-2000s. Well, we finally got another FF14 event, nearly a year after our most recent one, and boy was I all excited about a new reason to wax poetic regarding the world of Hydaelyn. Much to my dismay I found out that what we received is basically a rehash of a previous FF14 event with another fight or two tacked on at the end. But I will soldier on. Now, if memory serves me. The Story Thus Far When last we left our intrepid heroes, we had been introduced to a trio of Elezen heroes. After putting off the series for longer than expected, I finally got a chance to sit down and watch March Comes in Like a Lion. I had heard nothing but good things about this series, but I went in with no expectations. Mostly because I had forgotten all those words of praise. What finally got me to see the series was honestly watching several videos talking about the series. No grand revelation or anything of the sort. This is a huge text dump. Sorry, I wrote more than I expected. However After part 7 I decided to enjoy my vacations trying something different with JoJo, I read all the parts while listening to the songs/artists that are referenced there. It needs some adjustments as playing the song on repeat or playing it at 1.25x, but it's a totally new experience. Usually I followed the rule to only put the best song when it's their final battle. Part 2 ending was strange because it lacked a good song for Kars. Part 1 and 3 had pretty good endings So.how 'bout them remixes, folks? With Smash coming up soon, I wanted to talk about the new Splatoon remixes with my fellow octos and gentlesquids. A lot of this post I posted on r/smashbros, but I wanted to discuss this here as well, because I feel these songs are worth talking about, and I wanted to share my own thoughts and compare the originals with the remixes. Now, all this is my own opinion. Feel free to agree or disagree and share your own thoughts! Bomb Rush Blush. https://twitter.com/PodcastJump/status/1090778607566360576?s=09 (https://twitter.com/PodcastJump/status/1090778607566360576?s=09) So I've finished DQI-IV and had planned to finish V before XI, but let's just say I got carried away.

Every sidequest and mini-game finished, all items, weapons Hi everyone, Unovity here! I've been doing a series where I review the Black and White OST on my PokeAmino account and I figured you’d enjoy it too! Note that I didn't include some songs such as trainer encounters, victory battle music, bonus tracks, or any music from B2W2. I really wanted to share my opinion on these songs because I think they are truly a piece of art and I wanted to give my thoughts on what I feel when listening to the soundtrack. Also ratings are out of 5 stars. This intro. \#1: Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness followed by Tonight, Tonight from the album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFEftsKAUvY (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFEftsKAUvY) and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOG3eus4ZSo (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOG3eus4ZSo) OK, picking two songs for #1 is a bit of a cheat. If it makes it feel any less so, I would have put Tonight, Tonight at #1 by itself. The instrumental opener for the album. 
You can skip this and go to the first bolded title. 2018 has been quite a good year for me as far what I have been watching by getting back into anime. Two anime that I credit for getting me back into anime is My Hero Academia and the films A Silent Voice which I started watching/watched in 2016. I didnt watch much else until my first anime I watched for 2018 in january, which is the other show I credit for getting me back into anime. I am a full time college student and work, but nevertheless. Okay, everyone! Some of you may remember that we added a few hands to our moderation team a few weeks ago, including somebody familiar to many of you, at least if you check r/DDLC. However, you probably aren't as familiar with the other new recruits, and that's why we've decided to have this little mod-introduction session! …As well as u/TurretBot telling me we absolutely must do this because r/DDLC did it, ahaha~ Feel free to ask us questions in the comments if you'd like! We'll I think most people tend to agree that although the original series was better, 0 was absolutely fantastic as well. I personally think that Steins;Gate 0 lived up to the original and may have even surpassed it in some aspects. Putting both 0 and the OG together, they're 2nd on my all time anime list. Here I'll be doing a side by side comparison between the 2 series in consideration of both the VNs and the anime. However, I'll be spoiler marking anything from the VNs because for Steins;Gate.
